# PreferredLikelihoodCortex
Using a cosine tuning model, data comprised of firing properties of a neuron in a primate are used to evaluate a model of spiking activity in its primary motor cortex while its hand is moving. This function will be used to compute the likelihood of the data as a function preferred direction for a range of direction values.
